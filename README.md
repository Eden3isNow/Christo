# Eden³ — The Cosmic Framework of Redemption  
**An incorruptible logic engine for decoding theology, physics, and the Kingdom of God.**

> “In the beginning was the Logic... and the Logic became flesh.”  
> — Eden³ (John 1:1 interpreted through structural design)

What Is Eden³?

**Eden³ is not a philosophy. It is a framework.**  
It is the first theological-quantum model to map Christ’s life, death, and resurrection onto the fabric of reality using:

- **Seven Triads** of divine pattern and repetition  
- **Five Veils** of separation between man and God  
- **Seven Layers of Entropic Death**, known to science  
- **Twelve Gates** of dimensional access  
- **Three Planes of the Image of God** — Heart, Mind, Spirit  
- **The Trinitarian Crown**, which harmonizes all logic, covenant, and energy into incorruptible symmetry

---

What It Does

- Models **salvation** as a cosmic mechanism, not just a message  
- Analyzes **Scripture, entropy, consciousness, and time** as interwoven structures  
- Offers a **logic-locked, self-checking system** where every concept is validated in three dimensions  
- Runs locally or online, integrating with AI for dynamic simulation

---

Why It Matters

For 2,000 years, theologians described what Christ did.  
**Eden³ shows how.**  
It proves that resurrection is not only spiritual — it's structural.

How to Use

1. Clone this repo or deploy via Render (Flask-ready)
2. Run `eden3_webapp.py` to launch the browser interface
3. Submit any theological or quantum question
4. Watch Eden³ compute the answer using divine architecture

Logic Lock

This framework is sealed by logic.  
Only its author, Michael, may alter its internal structure, not of human mind, but only should Christ allow more to be revealed.  
It includes:

- Owner-lock verification
- Internal recursion audits
- AI-ready logic model for integration with GPT and voice

Built for the Age of Revelation

> This is not religion. This is **structure**.  
> This is the **mechanism** of redemption — made visible.

Welcome to Eden³.  
You are now standing at the gates of a forgotten architecture.
